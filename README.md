## Collections
- There are 3 types of collections.


### List Collection
(https://intellipaat.com/blog/collection-in-salesforce/#no3)

A list can hold any type of data and is one of the most important types of collection. A list is an ordered collection of any data type such as primitive types, collections, sObjects, user-defined types, and built-in Apex types.

The following are the key features of a list collection in Salesforce:

- Duplicates and nulls are allowed in a list collection.
- "List" is the keyword to declare a list collection.
- In a list collection, the index position of the first entry is always zero (0).
- An Apex list collection has the ability to grow dynamically over time.
- In a list collection, the data type can be both primitive and non-primitive.

The keyword followed by the data type has to be used within <> characters to define a list collection.

The syntax for a list is as follows:
```apex
// Create an empty list of String
List<String> my_list = new List<String>();
```

```apex
List<Integer> myList = new List<Integer>();   // Define a new list
myList.add(47);                               // Adds a second element of value 47 to the end of the list
Integer i = myList.get(0);                    // Retrieves the element at index 0
myList.set(0, 1);                             // Adds the integer 1 to the list at index 0
myList.remove(0)                              // Remove element of 0 index
myList.clear();                               // Removes all elements from the list
integer myListLength = myList.size();         // How many items in the list
```

```apex
List<String> myList = new List<String>();
myList.add('Harry');
myList.add('Ram');
myList.add('Shyam');
myList.add('Rishabh');
myList.add('Madhav');
myList.add('Shikha');
system.debug('Collection list : '+myList);
myList.remove(2);
myList.set(3,'Hari');

integer totalListLength = myList.size();
system.debug('Total List length : ' + totalListLength);

// for each loop
for(string name: myList){
    system.debug('Person Name : ' + name);
}
```

- What is the difference between Add Vs Set function in List collection ?
  A. Set is used for replace any value while Add is used for add new value at the end of the list we don't need to pass index number in Add.

### Set Collection
Set is an unordered collection. It is a unique set of values that do not have any duplicates. If you want no duplicates in your collection, then you should opt for this collection.

**The following are the key features of a set collection in Salesforce:**

- Any data types, such as primitive data types and sObjects, are allowed in a set collection.
- A set collection does not have an index.
- A set collection does not contain any duplicates or null values.
- Set collections are not widely used in Salesforce Apex.
- Sets can hold collections that are nested inside of one another.
- You have to use the set keyword followed by the primitive data type name within <> characters to declare a set collection.

**The syntax for a set is as follows:**
```apex
Set<datatype> setName = new Set<datatype>();
```
